# Software-Design-Template

This was a project for CS-230 where we were to a Software Design Template for a made up comapny named The Gaming Room. The Game Room was creating a game named "Draw It or Lose It", which is a web based game where two teams took turns guess on whatthe picture is. The picture would be drawn onto the screen slowly and would only reveal the whole picture if one of the teams guessed the right answer or if the time limit was reached. With this project I feel that I took a big step forward in understanding how to code. Knowing how to make a plan to code makes creating the program more manageable. If I had to improve something in this template I would want to improve my some answers. Couple of the answers feel weak, but I feel that with experience I will be able to improve those answers. 

In this project I was asked to implement The Game Room's request into the program. For example, they wanted two seperate teams with unique names, each player needed unique names, and each game would be a single instance. The importance of knowing what the user wants is because it is their idea, and they know what they want. It is a programmer's job to do supply the user with a program that is as close to want they requested. Some approaches I took to help create the code was to read through the code that was provided and get to know what each class's job was in the program.
